All living things have a soul, and that soul must be, to some extent, saturated with Vilix in order to function. Without Vilix, life can not exist. Things that are not traditionally considered to be living can also harbour a well of Vilix.

Each dimension is filled primarily with a unique type of Vilix which is considered local to that dimension. Any living thing that evolved, or evolved primarily, in a particular dimension will have evolved a soul that is compatible with the local type of Vilix. This makes interdimensional travel significantly more challenging.</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#relevance-to-souls","title":"Relevance to souls","text":"<p>All living souls contain some amount of Vilix.

For example, a soul containing twice the amount of Vilix as another will lose it at twice the rate, however, that rate will slow down as Vilix is lost.</p> <p>Vilix can be lost suddenly in larger quantities, all at once, due to physically and/or mentally traumatic events, such as injury or bereavement. Such traumatic events also cause a sudden 'contamination' of the Vilix that remains, in which the its quality is degraded.</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#vilix-intake","title":"Vilix intake","text":"<p>In contrast, Vilix is constantly fed into any soul as long as the correct type of Vilix is present in the space that the soul occupies.
