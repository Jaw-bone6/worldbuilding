# Vilix

Vilix is a fundamental energy, closely tied to all life, that permeates space.
All living things have a [soul](soul.md), and that soul must be, to some extent, saturated
with Vilix in order to function. Without Vilix, life can not exist.

### Types of Vilix

There are numerous types of Vilix (i.e., Vilix with a particular 'signature',
so to speak). Each [dimension](dimension.md) is filled primarily with a unique
type of Vilix which is considered local to that dimension. Any living thing
that evolved, or evolved primarily, in a particular dimension will have evolved
a soul that is compatible with the local type of Vilix. This makes
[interdimensional travel](dimension.md#travel-between-dimensions) significantly
more challenging.

### Relevance to souls

All living souls contain some amount of Vilix.
