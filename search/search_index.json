All living things have a soul, and that soul must be, to some extent, saturated with Vilix in order to function. Without Vilix, life can not exist. Things that are not traditionally considered to be living can also harbour a well of Vilix. Thus, there exists a general term for anything that has such a well: a 'Vilin' (pronounced /\u02c8va\u026al\u026an/)</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#types-of-vilix","title":"Types of Vilix","text":"<p>There are numerous types of Vilix (i.e., Vilix with a particular 'signature', so to speak). Each dimension is filled primarily with a unique type of Vilix which is considered local to that dimension. Any living thing that evolved, or evolved primarily, in a particular dimension will have evolved a soul that is compatible with the local type of Vilix. This makes interdimensional travel significantly more challenging.</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#relevance-to-souls","title":"Relevance to souls","text":"<p>All living souls contain some amount of Vilix. Life depends on Vilix for its existence and quality in many ways. The very presence of Vilix in a physical space is, by itself, conducive to the development of life.</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#vilix-loss","title":"Vilix loss","text":"<p>Vilix continuously leaks out of a soul at a rate directly proportional to its amount. For example, a soul containing twice the amount of Vilix as another will lose it at twice the rate, however, that rate will slow down as Vilix is lost.</p> <p>Vilix can be lost suddenly in larger quantities, all at once, due to physically and/or mentally traumatic events, such as injury or bereavement. Such traumatic events also cause a sudden 'contamination' of the Vilix that remains, in which the its quality is degraded.</p>"},{"location":"vilix/#vilix-intake","title":"Vilix intake","text":"<p>In contrast, Vilix is constantly fed into any soul as long as the correct type of Vilix is present in the space that the soul occupies. The rate at which this happens depends on the:</p> <ul> <li>soul's Vilix affinity (an inherent property that is somewhat hereditary)</li> <li>individual's physical health</li> <li>individual's mental health</li> <li>density of compatible Vilix at the soul's location.</li> </ul> <p>Low affinity, poor physical or mental health, and low density all hinder the soul's ability to absorb Vilix. As the rate of loss is dependent on the quantity, lower input causes the baseline level of Vilix in a soul to reduce. This baseline level is the quantity of Vilix resulting in a rate of loss equal to the rate of gain.</p> <p>The level of Vilix in a soul very directly affects the physical body to which the soul is bound. Low Vilix (or low-quality Vilix, see Vilix quality) hinders a living thing's body in a few ways:</p> <ul> <li>reduced ability to fight infections (i.e., reduced immune efficiency)</li> <li>reduced ability to repair damaged tissues</li> <li>greater susceptablity to mental conditions such as depression, amnesia (retrograde and anterograde and outright insanity (complete loss of one's mind, common in extreme cases of Vilix deprivation, leaves)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"vilix/#vilix-quality","title":"Vilix quality","text":""}]}
