# Vilix

Vilix (pronounced /ˈvɪlɪks/) is a fundamental energy, closely tied to all life,
that permeates space. All living things have a [soul](soul.md), and that soul
must be, to some extent, saturated with Vilix in order to function. Without
Vilix, life can not exist. Things that are not traditionally considered to be
living can also harbour a well of Vilix. Thus, there exists a general term for
anything that has such a well: a 'Vilin' (pronounced /ˈvaɪlɪn/)

### Types of Vilix

There are numerous types of Vilix (i.e., Vilix with a particular 'signature',
so to speak). Each [dimension](dimension.md) is filled primarily with a unique
type of Vilix which is considered local to that dimension. Any living thing
that evolved, or evolved primarily, in a particular dimension will have evolved
a soul that is compatible with the local type of Vilix. This makes
[interdimensional travel](dimension.md#travel-between-dimensions) significantly
more challenging.

### Relevance to souls

All living souls contain some amount of Vilix. Life depends on Vilix for its
existence and quality in many ways. The very presence of Vilix in a physical
space is, by itself, conducive to the development of life.

#### Vilix loss

Vilix continuously leaks out of a soul at a rate directly proportional to its
amount. For example, a soul containing twice the amount of Vilix as another
will lose it at twice the rate, however, that rate will slow down as Vilix is
lost.

Vilix can be lost suddenly in larger quantities, all at once, due to physically
and/or mentally traumatic events, such as injury or bereavement. Such traumatic
events also cause a sudden 'contamination' of the Vilix that remains, in which
the its [quality](#vilix-quality) is degraded.

#### Vilix intake

In contrast, Vilix is constantly fed into any soul as long as the correct type
of Vilix is present in the space that the soul occupies. The rate at which this
happens depends on the:

- soul's Vilix affinity (an inherent property that is somewhat hereditary)
- individual's physical health
- individual's mental health
- density of compatible Vilix at the soul's location.

Low affinity, poor physical or mental health, and low density all hinder the
soul's ability to absorb Vilix. As the rate of loss is dependent on the
quantity, lower input causes the baseline level of Vilix in a soul to reduce.
This baseline level is the quantity of Vilix resulting in a rate of loss equal
to the rate of gain.

#### Vilix level/quality effects

The level of Vilix in a soul very directly affects the physical body to which
the soul is bound. Low Vilix (or low-quality Vilix, see [Vilix
quality](#vilix-quality)) hinders a living thing's body in a few ways:

- reduced ability to fight infections (i.e., reduced immune efficiency)
- reduced ability to repair damaged tissues
- greater susceptablity to mental conditions such as depression, amnesia
([retrograde and anterograde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia#Types) and
outright insanity (complete loss of one's mind, common in extreme cases of
Vilix deprivation; the total destruction of one's personality and mental
capabilites such as critical thinking, logic, empathy, etc.)

### Vilix quality

The Vilix in a Vilin is of a certain quality ranging from perfect all the way
down to near useless. The quality of Vilix, together with the quantity, is one
of the two factors dictating the Vilin's physical and mental health. Vilix of
half the quality is only as good as half the amount of Vilix of the same
quality.

Vilix of quality spanning the whole possible spectrum exists. The quality a
Vilin is capable of absorbing depends on their physcal and mental health. The
more degraded these properties are, the lower the quality of Vilix that will be
absorbed.

### Vilix power

Vilix power is a term meaning the combination of quality and quantity of Vilix
in a Vilin, and is ultimately the single relevant factor in Vilix' capability
to maintain a Vilin's health.

### The spiral effect

As the power of Vilix affects the health of a Vilin, and the health, in turn,
affects the power of incoming Vilix, and trauma causes sudden reduction in
Vilix' power, Vilix exhibits a sort of "downward spiral effect" wherein reduced
Vilix power put the Vilin in a condition where recovery back to acceptable
levels is more difficult, resulting in lower Vilix power levels, and so on.
