# Soul

The soul is the immaterial part of a Vilin. It contains the personality,
thought, feelings, temperament, etc. of any living thing. A living thing is
typically defined as a physical object with a soul bound to it and executing
its will through it. This results in some considering what would otherwise be
inanimate object that happen to have souls and contain [Vilix](vilix.md) to be
living things just the same as any other.

A soul needn't be bound to a vessel in order to exist and function (see
[Unbound soul](unbound_soul.md)
