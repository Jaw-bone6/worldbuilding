# Unbound soul

An unbound soul is a soul which is not bound to a physical vessel. They are
formed on rare occasions, primarily where a Vilin has died and their soul, by
pure chance and mechanisms not exactly understood, has not been destroyed with
it. The soul persists and retains its capability to think and observe the
world. Unbound souls, not having physical bodies, lack sensory organs. Instead
the state of the world around them (in an volume that differs on an individual
basis) directly affects their minds. At first, the mind will not know how to
interpret these inputs. After an interval, typically lasting a week, the mind
will have adjusted to these inputs and the soul will regain something akin to
sight and hearing, though the sight is not restricted to a direction.
